## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke trust, intelligence, and security in financial analysis.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), very slightly tinted toward the indigo hue to reduce starkness and enhance readability.
- Accent color: Vivid chartreuse (#7FFF00) to highlight positive signals and confirmations, symbolizing growth and opportunity.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for both headings and body text, due to its clean and modern appearance.
- Use a consistent set of minimalistic icons, using financial metaphors. Example: arrow up, arrow down, line chart, magnifying glass.
- Design the layout to provide data as clear and actionable for trades. Ensure the alerts and all messages look simple, easy to understand, with consistent spacing and alignment to make it easier to parse the trade info at a glance.
- Incorporate subtle animations (e.g. a brief highlight or change in color) when a new trade signal is generated or when the status of a signal changes.
